% generated document comes from the bibliography file, including the notes field which will
% provide the annotations.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
My topic is recent advances in the computational photography used in smartphones. Specifically looking at the use of multi-frame algorithms to increase image resolution and quality. I'm mainly looking at a couple of papers by researchers at Google on algorithms used in the Super-Res Zoom and Night Sight features of the Google Pixel series of smartphones.

\section{Discussion of sources}


\subsection{Sources I expect to use (and how)}

My primary two sources are \cite{Wronski2019, Liba2019}.


% The following two commands are all you need to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% annotated_bibliography.bib is the name of the BibTex file containing 
% all the bibliography entries for this example. Note that you *don't* include the .bib ending
% in the \bibliography command.
\bibliography{paper}  

% You must have a ".bib" file and remember to run:
%     pdflatex bibtex pdflatex pdflatex
% in order to see all the citation references correctly.
